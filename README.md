# Article-Dataset

You can find datasets referred to in the article "An iterative methodology for solving Multidisciplinary Optimization by combining Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks" (E.Comapgnone,G.Pesare,C.Delprete). The datsets were created automatically through subsequent FE analyses during the process and used to train neural networks. For each case study there is an excel file with input and output relating to the various iterations of the optimization process.

Case study A: input=radii of 10 bars                           output=axial stress of 10 bars 
Case study B: input=thicknesses and materials of 9 components  output=max Von Mises stress of 10 components

The details about case studies are described in the manuscript
