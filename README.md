# Article-Dataset

You can find datasets referred to in the article "An iterative methodology for solving Multidisciplinary Optimization by combining Genetic Algorithm and Neural Networks" (E.Comapgnone,G.Pesare,C.Delprete). The datsets were created automatically through subsequent FE analyses during the process and used to train neural networks. For both case studies there is a folder that contains csv file for each iteration of the optimization process. The first column refers to the number of models, while the first row refers to the name of input and output. Output are separated from input by a blank space between semicolons.

Case study A: input=radii of 10 bars; output=axial stress of 10 bars.
Case study B: input=thicknesses and materials of 9 components; output=max Von Mises stress of 10 components

The details about case studies are described in the manuscript
